# 👋 Hey, I'm MimoAlexer!

Im a 14-year-old developer who loves building and exploring all kinds of games and systems. I'm especially into:

- 🛠️ Programming in **Rust**, **C#**, **Java**, **Etc**.
- 🏰 Medieval games and uhmm idk Cs2(kinda based🗿)
- 🖥️ Old-school **terminal-based games** (think Dwarf Forest vibes!)
- 🌐 Servers, backends, and anything that runs behind the scenes

Im always learning and experimenting — from building small games to tinkering with server setups. If you like low level coding, medieval worlds, or just cool first person shooter games, well, dont contact me, please!

Feel goooooood to check out my projects and please dont say hi! 😄
